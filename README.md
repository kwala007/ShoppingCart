# Shopping Cart

I have been researching in the Robotics, Automation, and Mechatronics lab at Rutgers University since the summer of 2020 and am working with members of the lab to develop a human-following autonomous shopping cart for safe shopping in crowded environments. 

More information regarding the project can be found (here)[vkh12.github.io]. 

This folder contains all of the code for my Shopping Cart research project.
